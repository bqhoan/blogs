#### CSS Styling for Cover Images

[](https://github.com/anpigon/obsidian-book-search-plugin#css-styling-for-cover-images)

For those who enable this feature, we've added CSS styling to ensure that cover images are displayed effectively without disrupting the flow of information. To add this CSS snippet in Obsidian, you can either include it directly in your plugin's CSS file or insert it into Obsidian's custom CSS section for your vault. Here's how to add the CSS snippet for styling the book suggestions with cover images:

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Navigate to Settings > Appearance.
3. Under the CSS Snippets section, click on Open snippets folder.
4. Create a new .css file in this folder and paste the following CSS snippet into the file.
5. Go back to Obsidian, and under CSS Snippets, turn on the snippet you just added.
